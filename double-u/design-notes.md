# Exploratory Notes on `W` language's design, purpose, scope, and implementation

#### Initial Idea / Example

An extrememly simple I/O based domain language, where W means 'write', to write output..
to file, to stream, to json, to html.. etc.

Organization:
If writing in Crystal..it needs modularized, and possibly use other languages
as well for special functionality (eg: extra scripting capability for tooling).

- Runtime, Interpretter, REPL, transpilation, networking/web ready, cross-platform,
- concurrency, real parallelism
- code re-write at runtime, code rewind, state-save, code-replay, system-constraints/aware
